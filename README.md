# jello67.github.io.collection
My project is a collection game. I made my project to learn more about how objects move across the screen and how to be able to use JavaScript. It was very time consuming getting the locations correct and other elements. I incorporated a slider which can respond to the arrow keys so the user can play the game. I had a hard time learning and being able to properly use some of the code. I learned how to use JavaScript to make games!
